logging:
	- log to correct location
	  the difficulty is getting the path into the log4j.properties file
	  alternative: constructing the real path at runtime
	  best: replace a property in the config file at runtime, while reading it

save & load options:
	- using serialization
		* groovy built-in
		* XStream (XML)
	- save nothing, but (re-)analyze the battle
	  pro: makes the AI suitable for jump-in-AI if a human player leaves the battle

discuss the AIs basic architecture:
	eg, should we use an agent based approach?
