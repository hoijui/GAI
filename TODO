                         Groovy Artificial Intelligence
                  A skirmish AI for the Spring RTS game engine

                                      TODO

logging:
 - log to correct location
   the difficulty is getting the path into the log4j.properties file
   alternative: constructing the real path at runtime
   best: replace a property in the config file at runtime, while reading it

save & load options:
 - using serialization
   * groovy built-in
   * XStream (XML)
 - save nothing, but (re-)analyze the battle
   pro: makes the AI suitable for jump-in-AI if a human player leaves the battle
